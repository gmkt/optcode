executable usage:<br>
ctd _distance_<br>
generates codes with maximum possible size and minimum length using hypothesis that these codes can be generated recursively<br>
ctd_reusable _input_file_path_<br>
does the same as ctd but uses input_file_path as recursion base with following format:<br>
_matrices_num_ _rows_num_ _cols_num_ _distance_<br>
_Matrix_description_1_<br>
_Matrix_description_2_<br>
...<br>
_Matrix_description_matrices_num_<br>
Matrix description is basically matrix itself written down with spaces inbetween 1s or 0s.<br>
There's example input.txt
